# BEE WISE

We created a sustainable tutoring website named BeeWise Tutoring using HTML, CSS, and JS, along with the React framework. This allows students at SCU to offer their knowledge and services based on classes they've taken and tutor other students. Each tutoring session fills up the user's honey jar in their profile section. Once the honey jar is filled up, it engages the student in sustainable living. SCU will donate a sum of money to tree organizations and plant trees to sustain bee environments around the globe. 

## FILES

### App.js

This file is what uses REACT to connect all of our pages and files together.

### Home

The home js and css files contain the code for the page where you can login or sign up.

### Login

The login js and css files contain the code for creating an account and saving your information. You will then be guided to the selection page.

### Selection

In this page you can select whether you would like to be a tutor or need to be tutored. The code for these are in the selection js and css files.

### Search Classes

The search classes js and css files hold the code for selecting which classes you would like to tutor or need to be tutored for. This will then guide you to the page with currently available tutors.

### Available Tutors

After selecting a class you will be able to see the available tutors for that class. If the tutor is available, after clicking on their name it will send you to a zoom link. If not, then it will link to their profile. The code for this is in the tutors js and css files.

### Compiling

These files were all connected using REACT in App.js. Packages were updated and stored in the package json files.
